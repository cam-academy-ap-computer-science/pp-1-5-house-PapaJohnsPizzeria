Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the set of
methods that did the verses, and a comment for the set of
methods that did the individual lines within the verses.

There is one efficiency that could be added.  Notice that
every time you call thatMalt(), you call house() immediately afterwards.
Therefore, you could add house() at the end of your thatMalt() method, and
remove it from the verse methods.  Then, you could do the same thing
with thatRat() (add thatMalt() at the end of it), etc.  Your maiden() function,
then, would have just your first printed line, and the thatCow()
method, and everything else would happen automatically.
